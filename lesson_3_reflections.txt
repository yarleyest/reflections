When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Specially when your programming in group, because it's neccesary to have a place
where all people can access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it could have some branches or experimental parts of the code you are not
sure of their behaviour and you prefer don't release that to your group.
Maybe you want to avoid confusing things in your group repository or not inject
a bug.
