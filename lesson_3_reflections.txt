When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Specially when your programming in group, because it's neccesary to have a place
where all people can access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it could have some branches or experimental parts of the code you are not
sure of their behaviour and you prefer don't release that to your group.
Maybe you want to avoid confusing things in your group repository or not inject
a bug.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks to get a copy of a public repository from GitHub
Clones to get a copy of a repository of your Github to your local or clone a
repository in other part or your local device
Branches are divergent o difference lines of your group of commit. You used to
create a divergent line of your current code (master). It's possible to use in
local and push/pull to Github

Definitely you use fork in Github, the other ones are possibilities for both of
them and depend if you need a copy of someone else repository from Github (you use
fork), if you need a copy for yourself from Github or local (you use clone) or
make a new line to experiment or test changes in your programa (you use branch)
